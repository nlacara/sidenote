            The goal of this small project is to create simple <span class="sc">css</span> code for placing running side notes<span class='note'>This is a side note. It is positioned with a right float.</span> in <span class="sc">html</span> pages.             Inspired by my brother, I have recently considered beginning to blog again in a small scale context, but wanted to do so in a layout that I though most comfortably communicated information to the reader. I like side notes as a way of communicating additional information or side thoughts to the reader, and so I designed this simple <span class="sc">css</span> code for handling side notes.

    <h2>
        Inspiration
    </h2>
    
        <p>
            I've used margin notes to great effect in lecture materials<span class="note">See the lecture notes posted <a href="https://nlacara.github.io/teaching/331S18/index.html" class="ext">here</a>.</span> and physical handouts for presentations. Having footnotes at the bottom of a page is very inconvenient and can interrupt the flow of the content for the reader (especially given that much of my audience would consume these materials on devices like tablets and laptops). Of course one way to solve this problem is to remove notes entirely, or else cut down their number significantly. There's some value in doing that, but I find that notes outside the main text can often be very valuable. Consequently, I wanted to implement a similar functionality for use on the web.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
        
            <li>
                <span class="note">For more background on this project, the discussion <a class="ext" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB" clas="ext">here</a>.</span>I originally became interested in the use of margin notes and side notes when I ran across the <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/" class="ext">Tufte-LaTeX</a> class, which attempts to implement the style and page layout of Edward R. Tufte and Richard Feynman.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                I wanted to implement functionality similar to the <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/marginnote?lang=en" class="ext">marginnote</a> package available for LaTeX, wherein one can simply use the <code>\marginnote{}</code> command to insert marginal notes in the text.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Using this package, I implemented fairly robust handling of margin notes and footnotes in my <a href="https://github.com/nlacara/lingdoc" class="ext">LaTeX style file for linguistics</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>
        Implementation
    </h2>
    
        <p>
            Most of the work here is done with <span class="sc">css</span>. While I experimented using spans with absolute position attributes, I ultimately landed on using floating spans. First, the text must be limited to take up only a fraction of the available screen width:
        </p>
        
        <p class="codeblock">
            <span class="note">I recommend limiting the maximum width of the text, as shown here, since reading longer lines of text is harder.</span>
            div {                       <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;width: 75%;       <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 45em;  <br>
            }

        </p>
        
        <p>
            The width of the side note should fit in the leftover space to the right.<span class="note">As far as I can tell, if you use a percentage, which I hvae, this is calculated as part of the width of the main text, not the total screen width.</span> The key to making this work is to introduce a negative margin whose absolute value is greater than the width of the side note:        
        </p>
        
        <p class="codeblock">
            span.note { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;float: right;         <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;width: 28%;           <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: -32%;   <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;position: relative;   <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: left;     <br>
            }

        </p>
        
        <p>
            This makes it possible to simply surround the intended side note with <code>&lt;span&gt;&hellip;&lt;/span&gt;</code> tags, making the behavior somewhat akin to a LaTeX environment.
        </p>
        
    <h2>
        Other features
    </h2>
        
        <p>
            This <span class='sc'>css</span> file, as can be seen above, has a special class for code blocks, as well as a class for block quotes (though this is distinct from the <span class="sc">html</span> <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>
        
        <p class='blockquote'>
            This is an example of a block quote, called as <code>&lt;p class="blockquote"&gt;</code>. The code blocks can be called with <code>&lt;p class="codeblock"&gt;</code>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Really, though, this style sheet is a work in progress which I modify as necessary to suit my needs.
